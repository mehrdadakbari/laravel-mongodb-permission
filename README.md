# Associate users with roles and permissions (Mongodb/Moloquent)

This package allows to save permissions and roles in a database. It is built extend from [Spatie Laravel Permission](https://github.com/spatie/laravel-permission)

Once installed you can do stuff like this:

```php
//adding permissions to a user
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

//adding permissions via a role
$user->assignRole('writer');
$user2->assignRole('writer');

$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

You can test if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can`-function.
```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

## Install

You can install the package via composer:
``` bash
$ composer require Mehrdadakbari/laravel-mongodb-permission
```

This service provider must be installed. And Spatie provider too.
```php
// config/app.php
'providers' => [
    ...
    Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider::class,
    Mehrdadakbari\Mongodb\Permissions\PermissionServiceProvider::class,
];
```

You can publish the config-file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

This is the contents of the published config file:

```php
// config/laravel-permission.php

return [

    /*

    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    ],

];
```

Adjust the `table_names` config above for support mongodb many to many relationships (using EmbedsMany)

```php
    'user_has_permissions' => Mehrdadakbari\Mongodb\Permissions\Models\EmbedPermission::class,
    'user_has_roles' => Mehrdadakbari\Mongodb\Permissions\Models\EmbedRole::class,
    'role_has_permissions' => Mehrdadakbari\Mongodb\Permissions\Models\EmbedPermission::class,
```

## Usage

First add the `Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles`-trait to your User model.

```php
use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Spatie\Permission\Traits\HasRoles;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use HasRoles;

    // ...
}
```

This package allows for users to be associated with roles. Permissions can be associated with roles.
A `Role` and a `Permission` are regular Eloquent-models. They can have a name and can be created like this:

```php
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Role;
use Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission;

$role = Role::create(['name' => 'writer']);
$permission = Permission::create(['name' => 'edit articles']);
```

The `HasRoles` adds eloquent relationships to your models, which can be accessed directly or used as a base query.

```php
$permissions = $user->permissions;
$roles = $user->roles()->pluck('name'); // returns a collection
```

###Using permissions
A permission can be given to a user:

```php
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles');

//you can also give multiple permission at once
$user->givePermissionTo('edit articles', 'delete articles');

//you may also pass an array
$user->givePermissionTo(['edit articles', 'delete articles']);
```

A permission can be revoked from a user:

```php
$user->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

You can test if a user has a permission:
```php
$user->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

Saved permissions will be registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate`-class. So you can
test if a user has a permission with Laravel's default `can`-function.
```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

###Using roles and permissions
A role can be assigned to a user:

```php
$user->assignRole('writer');

// you can also assign multiple roles at once
$user->assignRole('writer', 'admin');
$user->assignRole(['writer', 'admin']);
```

A role can be removed from a user:

```php
$user->removeRole('writer');
```

Roles can also be synced :

```php
//all current roles will be removed from the user and replace by the array given
$user->syncRoles(['writer', 'admin']);
```

You can determine if a user has a certain role:

```php
$user->hasRole('writer');
```

You can also determine if a user has any of a given list of roles:
```php
$user->hasAnyRole(Role::all());
```
You can also determine if a user has all of a given list of roles:

```php
$user->hasAllRoles(Role::all());
```

The `assignRole`, `hasRole`, `hasAnyRole`, `hasAllRoles`  and `removeRole`-functions can accept a
 string, a `Spatie\Permission\Models\Role`-object or an `\Illuminate\Support\Collection`-object.

A permission can be given to a role:

```php
$role->givePermissionTo('edit articles');
```


You can determine if a role has a certain permission:

```php
$role->hasPermissionTo('edit articles');
```

A permission can be revoked from a role:

```php
$role->revokePermissionTo('edit articles');
```

The `givePermissionTo` and `revokePermissionTo`-functions can accept a
string or a `Spatie\Permission\Models\Permission`-object.

Saved permission and roles are also registered with the `Illuminate\Auth\Access\Gate`-class.
```php
$user->can('edit articles');
```

###Using blade directives
This package also adds Blade directives to verify whether the
currently logged in user has all or any of a given list of roles.

```php
@role('writer')
I'm a writer!
@else
I'm not a writer...
@endrole
```

```php
@hasrole('writer')
I'm a writer!
@else
I'm not a writer...
@endhasrole
```

```php
@hasanyrole(Role::all())
I have one or more of these roles!
@else
I have none of these roles...
@endhasanyrole
```

```php
@hasallroles(Role::all())
I have all of these roles!
@else
I don't have all of these roles...
@endhasallroles
```

You can use Laravel's native `@can` directive to check if a user has a certain permission.

## Using a middleware
The package doesn't contain a middleware to check permissions but it's very trivial to add this yourself.

``` bash
$ php artisan make:middleware RoleMiddleware
```

This will create a RoleMiddleware for you, where you can handle your role and permissions check.
```php
// app/Http/Middleware/RoleMiddleware.php
use Auth;

...

public function handle($request, Closure $next, $role, $permission)
{
    if (Auth::guest()) {
        return redirect($urlOfYourLoginPage);
    }

    if (! $request->user()->hasRole($role)) {
       abort(403);
    }

    if (! $request->user()->can($permission)) {
       abort(403);
    }

    return $next($request);
}
```

Don't forget to add the route middleware to your Kernel:

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php
protected $routeMiddleware = [
    ...
    'role' => \App\Http\Middleware\RoleMiddleware::class,
    ...
];
```

Now you can protect your routes using the middleware you just set up:

```php
Route::group(['middleware' => ['role:admin,access_backend']], function () {
    //
});
```

## Extending

If you need to extend or replace the existing `Role` or `Permission` models you just need to
keep the following things in mind:

- Your `Role` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Role` contract
- Your `Permission` model needs to implement the `Spatie\Permission\Contracts\Permission` contract
- You must publish the configuration with this command: `php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Spatie\Permission\PermissionServiceProvider" --tag="config"` and update the `models.role` and `models.permission` values

## Unit Test
